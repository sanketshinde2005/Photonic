# Photonic
## Overview
Photonic is a dynamic image gallery webpage that fetches and displays images from the Unsplash API based on a user's search query. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing users with a seamless experience to search and view high-quality images related to any specific keyword.

## Features
Search Functionality: Users can input a keyword to search for images related to that word.
Real-Time Image Display: The webpage fetches images from the Unsplash API in real-time and displays them instantly.
Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across all devices.
Infinite Scroll (Optional): The webpage can be configured to load more images as the user scrolls down, providing a continuous stream of images.

## Technologies Used
HTML: Structures the webpage elements and content.
CSS: Styles the webpage, creating an attractive and user-friendly interface.
JavaScript: Handles the logic for interacting with the Unsplash API, managing user inputs, and dynamically updating the webpage content.

## How It Works
1.User Input:
The webpage features a search bar where users can enter a keyword (e.g., "mountains," "sunset").
Upon submitting the search, a JavaScript function is triggered to handle the API request.
Fetching Images:

2.The JavaScript code sends a request to the Unsplash API using the search keyword provided by the user.
The API responds with a collection of images that match the keyword.
Displaying Images:

3.The webpage processes the API response, extracting the image URLs and other relevant data.
These images are then displayed in a grid format on the webpage, allowing users to browse through them easily.

## Future Enhancements
Advanced Search Filters: Allow users to filter images by orientation, color, or image type (photo, illustration).
Image Details: Provide a modal or overlay that displays additional information about the image when clicked.
User Authentication: Enable users to log in and save their favorite images or collections.
